# Basic Recipe App with React JS

A very basic recipe app based on react. Here I used an API to fetch the data of the recipe and filter those according to the search. Finally show the output based on the search.

Edamam was used to fetch the data using basic API. 

## Future Work

I will upload the project on Firebase and share the live link as well thouhg it's a very basic app.
